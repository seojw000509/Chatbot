# Chatbot
 The goal of this project is to make a Korean chatbot by using transformer. This chatbot gives response when ones type something by keyboard. By using transformer, one can get better response that can consider the context of question. Chatting dataset, which consists of pairs of question and answer, is used for training. First I downloaded chatting dataset and preprocessed it. Then I built transformer by keras. Finally I trained transformer by preprocessed dataset and check whether it works well. To run the code, one can just implement given codes and type something as follows: output=predict("~"). The examples of chatbot's response is as follows. The performance of chatbot relies on the quality of chatting dataset, so developing high quality of dataset will make chatbot more likely to human.
